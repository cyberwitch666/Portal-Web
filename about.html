      <h2><mark>About</mark></h2>
      <p>This project was birthed by Cy X, a black queer agender cyberwitch, energetic herbalist, and pleasure ceremonialist. Cy attended New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program from 2019 to 2021 and spent their years there trying to figure out what exactly magic, rituals, spiritual practices, and technology had to do with each other. Intuitively, right before they entered the program they began calling themselves a cyberwitch which perhaps was a spell in and of itself.</p>
      <p>Moving through tech-focused spaces has not been easy and what they encountered was oftentimes a sense of tech-elitism that prioritized certain forms of knowledge over others, in addition, to a widespread ignoring the impacts that the tech industry and its “emerging” tools have on the world, people of color, woman, gender non-conforming people, trans people, people of color, incarcerated people, and disabled people.</p>
      <p>When did technology become something that was mostly associated with machines and the software of so-called “genius” white men?</p>

      <h2><mark>Setting the Intentions</mark></h2>
      <p>This coven, the workbook, and any resulting spells were created to center the experiences of black and brown queeer and trans people, many of whose technologies have been regarded as inferior, obsolete, unintelligible.</p>

      <p>The spells here are not and will never be for institutions who are seeking to commodify and co-op any of these spells for their own material gains and ego. You have been warned.</p>

      <h2><mark>Coven</mark></h2>
      <p>This project, like many things, was not created in energetic isolation. This workbook began as my 2021 Processing Foundation Fellowship project with Johanna Hedva as mentor.</p>
      <p>The Processing Foundation supports artists, coders, and collectives in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability. At their core is the philosophy and politics of FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software.)</p>

      <p>As a result, this project is also rooted in the philosophy and politics of FLOSS</p>
      <p>This project will continue and be developed further in residency at The Culture Hub.</p>
      <p>I also would like to acknowledge and give thanks to the works of those within my community, other artists, thinkers, witches, and magic makers who have also inspired me. They are attributed in the resource and lineage section in the Library.</p>

      <h2><mark>Join Us</mark></h2>
